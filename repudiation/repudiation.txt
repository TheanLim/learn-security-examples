- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Vulnerable because there's no way to identify the bad actor. Secure version logs each HTTP method, url and IP with timestamp. 
It also logs error, if applicable.

Additional mechanism: 
- ensure that the logs are secured (such as storing it in a safeguarded db, sanitize incoming query).
- Introduce auditing policy such as running a script that runs nightly to flag for specific patterns for deeper checks.
