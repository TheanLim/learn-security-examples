Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Information Disclosure: unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. 
In the insecure version: bad actors could inject sql statements that will be used to query the database. 
For example, http://localhost:3000/userinfo?username[$ne]=
The secure version ensures that the incoming userID is a string and performs database query using sanitized username

The confidentiality property of the CIA is violated.

Additional mechanism: MFA and better access control to the database.
