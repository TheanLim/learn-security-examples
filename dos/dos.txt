- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Denial of Service happens when a services is loaded with tons of request or exploited with its vulnerability. Either of this causes ther server to crash
In this code example, the input query parameter ID is not sanitized, and that causes the server to crash when the wrong ID is provided, and the DB is queried.
The secure version safeguard this by adding a try-catch block to handle errors instead of letting the error to crash the server.

Additional mechanisms:  include rate limiting, and potentially adding captcha if needed.
